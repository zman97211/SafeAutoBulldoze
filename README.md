This will be a simple auto-bulldoze script that does the minimum possible to accomplish the job.

The small set of requirements should lead to small code that is easy to check for correctness.

Currently removed abandoned and burned down buildings every 5 game seconds. No animation/sound is
played, they simply disappear ...

Bits of code comes from "Automatic Bulldoze" by Sadler. I searched for "bulldoze", sorted by "Top Rated All Time", and that was the top result. I looked at the source code (which for some reason had the extension .ccs instead of .cs) and was dismayed at what I saw. Frankly, the code is a mess.

I must state I know next to nothing about modding Cities: Skylines, but I am a professional software engineer
and have some experience writing plug-ins for Kerbal Space Program.
